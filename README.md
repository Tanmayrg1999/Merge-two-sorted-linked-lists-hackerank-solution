# Merge-two-sorted-linked-lists-hackerank-solution
Merging two sorted linked list is performed by the use of three pointers i.e. p pointer that points to the head of first linked list ,q pointer that points to the head of second linked list and head pointer that points to the head of new linked list. The corresponding value which is less among the p and q pointer is pushed untill end of any list is reached. If on reaching the end if still any list is left to be evaluated then the while loop is used which simply pushes the data in the new link list referenced by the head pointer.
